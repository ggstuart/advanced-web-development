> 2002 - 2006

> The [XHTML 2.0] standard was under development for many years.
> Being *backwards incompatable* with earlier versions, it was a controversial project, lacking resilience.

> *Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group* (WHATWG) is founded and begins work on an HTML 5 standard *for W3C*.

> 2004

> January 2008

> [HTML 5] standard is released *by W3C*, including `<video>`, `<audio>` and `<canvas>` elements as well as semantic elements such as `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<aside>`, `<nav>`, and `<figure>`.

> Development of XHTML 2.0 is abandoned and it is eventually published *as a "note"*.

> July 2009

> January 2011

> WHATWG rename HTML 5 to the [HTML living standard].
> New features can be added but functionality will not be removed.

> W3C cede authority over the HTML and DOM standards to WHATWG.
The *HTML living standard* is the current standards document.
