We spent some time last year introducing the foundations of HTML and CSS.

>- **The web is resilient by design**
>- HTML is the core
>    - Semantics
>    - **Accessibility**
>    - Search engine optimisation
>- HTML, CSS and JavaScript are *decoupled*
>    - HTML is for *content*
>    - CSS is for *presentation*
>    - JavaScript is for *behaviour*

>- HTML syntax is pretty simple
>    - documents have **structure**
>    - **tags** provide semantics
>    - **attributes** provide further meaning
>    - Browsers can render elements differently
>- CSS syntax is also simple
>    - selectors
>    - properties
>    - values
>- Managing CSS can be complex


>- CSS basics
>    - Fonts
>    - **The box model**
>    - *Block* and *inline* elements
>- CSS layouts
>    - Default flow
>    - **Flexbox**
>    - **Grid**
