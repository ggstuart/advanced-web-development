> Web standards evolve through a collaborative process.
They form the backbone of interoperable, accessible, and secure online experiences, ensuring consistency across browsers, servers, and devices. 

The **Internet Engineering Task Force** ([IETF]) handles protocols like [HTTP].
The core document is [RFC 9110: HTTP Semantics].

The **World Wide Web Consortium** ([W3C]) focuses on [HTML], [CSS], and accessibility.
They publish a regular [CSS snapshot] document. 

The **Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group** ([WHATWG]) maintains the [HTML living standard]

**ECMA International** ([ECMA]) standardize ECMAScript ([JavaScript]). 
The core document is [ECMA-262].

> **However, browsers don't always implement the standards immediately.**
>
> For our purposes, the [Mozilla Developer Network] is the best source of practical guidance on [HTML]. [CSS] and [JavaScript].
