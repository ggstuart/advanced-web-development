Using JavaScript to modify the DOM in response to user interaction turns a simple website into a web application, even without a back-end.

When the browser parses HTML and constructs the DOM, it can also load scripts.
Scripts have complete power over the webpage, converting a static DOM into a dynamic user interface.

```js
console.log("Hello world!!")
```

A web page is more fun with JavaScript.
