This unit will cover more advanced JavaScript code structure, including the use of modules, objects and classes.

We have seen the JavaScript object literal syntax can be used as a way to store simple key/value pairs. 

```js
const obj = {
    key1: 'value1',
    key2: 'value2'
}
```

JavaScript objects are much more powerful than a simple associative array. They can be used to create elegant code which is much more difficult using a purely functional style.
