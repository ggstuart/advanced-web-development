This site introduces more front-end web technologies.
Web standards move fast and new capabilities are introduced continuously.
We will explore what JavaScript can do in the browser and how to make dynamic front-end applications that interact with web APIs.

Each week there will be two lectures introducing concepts and two lab sessions where you will get your hands dirty.
