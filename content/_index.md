title: Advanced Web Development
---

This site introduces more web technologies.
Web standards move fast and new capabilities are introduced continuously.
We will explore what JavaScript can do on the server and in the browser and how to make dynamic applications using web standards.

Each week there will be two lectures introducing concepts, a lab session where you will get your hands dirty and a seminar for consolidating what we have learned.
